# We deliberately don't directly use the host dictionary files.
# Instead, we use their names to know which ones the user has
# installed on their system, and we use the corresponding ones
# we primed in '$SNAP/usr/share/hunspell' in our 'hunspell' part.
#
# - We don't set DICPATH=/var/lib/snapd/hostfs/usr/share/hunspell
#   to avoid potential incompatibility due to different hunspell
#   versions inside the snap and outside on the host.  See:
#   https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/pull/11025
#
# - We don't set DICPATH="$SNAP/usr/share/hunspell" because that
#   would result in all available dictionaries we primed in our
#   'hunspell' part being displayed in Firefox's interface,
#   presenting an overwhelming number of options to the user.
#   So instead we only use those that were installed on the host.
#   This way, the user could affect the dictionaries available to
#   Firefox snap similarly to how they could for non-snap Firefox.
